      <h1>How to Use it </h1>
      <p>
      Use this calculator to calculate grade point average (GPA) and generate a GPA report. Grade point average (GPA) is a commonly used indicator of an individual's academic achievement in school. 
      It is the average of the grades attained in each course, taking course credit into consideration. Grading systems vary in different countries, or even schools.  This calculator accepts letter grades as well as numerical inputs. These letter grades are translated into numerical values as shown below.
<br />
A+ = 4.3 grade points   <br />
A = 4 grade points  <br />
A- = 3.7 grade points  <br />
B+ = 3.3 grade points  <br />
B = 3 grade points  <br />
B- = 2.7 grade points  <br />
C+ = 2.3 grade points  <br />
C = 2 grade points  <br />
C- = 1.7 grade points  <br />
D+ = 1.3 grade points  <br />
D = 1 grade point  <br />
D- = 0.7 grade points  <br />
F = 0 grade points  <br />
P (pass), NP (not pass), I (incomplete), W (withdrawal) will be ignored.
Most schools, colleges, and universities in the United States use a grading system based on the letters above, though E is sometimes used instead of F. Grading systems do differ however based on what constitutes an A or B, and some do not include grades such as an A+ or a B-. Others may attribute more weight to certain courses, and thus whatever grade is attained in the course will have a larger effect on overall GPA. The calculator can account for this based on the number of credits attributed to a course, where credit is the "weighting" of the course</p>
    <h1>Guidelines for raising GPA</h1>
    <p>There is no sure formula for raising a person's GPA, and strategies that work for one person may not work for another. However, there are some common guidelines and study habits that can be helpful when trying to raise GPA. The guidelines below are mostly anecdotal and are not intended as fail-safe ways to raise one's GPA, but are generally good habits that can have positive effects on learning, which may in turn increase GPA.</p>
    <h1>Actively attending classes:</h1>
    <p>Classes are being paid for likely either by a student or their parent, and not attending classes is both a financial loss, as well as a loss in potential education. While a student may decide that attending a particular class is not beneficial to their learning, or not a good use of their time, even if the professor is largely ineffective, there is usually valuable information that can be obtained simply by attending class. Not attending class for example, could result in negative effects on a student's GPA if for some reason the student misses information about a change in exam location or material.

Furthermore, while it may be true that professors largely repeat notes in class that are often later posted to a website, skipping classes can result in missed opportunities. Questions from students in class, as well as the explanations that may follow can provide seemingly inconsequential bits of information that can in fact make a large difference on tests. This is because interaction with the professor and other students can increase a person's depth of knowledge on a subject, or may provide the small tip necessary to solidify a student's understanding of a topic.

In addition, attending class, particularly if the class is smaller in size, can allow the professor to link a name, a face, and a grade, particularly if the student actively participates. Professors that see attentive and involved students are more inclined to be understanding of any potential issues that may arise such as emergencies resulting in missed due dates. Along with this, active participation is more likely to engage a student's mind in regards to the subject matter than reading online notes or a textbook, and points of confusion can also be clarified on the spot. These can in turn affect a person's grade and overall GPA.</p>
   <h1>Planning:
</h1>
<p>Every student has his or her own learning style. Some like to work for hours at a time to complete an assignment, while others may take many breaks. There is no ideal strategy, and how a person approaches learning is highly dependent on learning style, as well as adhering to a study strategy that complements their schedule and desires. The method that maximizes the value of the time spent is likely the most effective for improving learning, and subsequently, GPA.

Organization of work that needs to be done, as well as notes taken is also important. It is as important to be able to find relevant information as it is to take notes in class. Notes are most valuable when they can be used to supplement learning. Professors present large amounts of information during the course of a lecture, not all of which a student may have time to process. It is important to practice taking notes in a manner that enables the student to look back and learn (or lookup) the information.

Time management is also an important aspect of planning. There are only 24 hours in a day, not all of which a person can use effectively. While learning is important, taking more courses or activities than a person can handle can be detrimental both to learning, as well as to average GPA. Once all courses have been selected, budgeting and scheduling time for each course can help to put the amount of work and time necessary into perspective. While the amount of work necessary for a number of courses may initially seem daunting, planning how and when to approach the work for each course may help reduce stress and improve efficiency once the work is quantified (or could help a person realize that they are tackling more than they can handle).

Reviewing work regularly, in terms of studying, is another aspect of time management. A substantial amount of information is covered in a course by the time of the final exam, and reviewing some of the information regularly over a period of time is often more effective than attempting to memorize all of the information right before an exam. Learning the information through periodic review can ultimately save a person more time, and potentially position them to perform better on an exam, and thereby improve GPA.</p>
